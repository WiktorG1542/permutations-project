your input file should look like this:
n
v1 v2
v1 v2
...
(for a total of n lines, each containing a pair of v1 v2 separated by a space).
the input file cannot contain any characters other than numbers, spaces, newlines and minuses.
if you wish for the program to write out all possible permutations in lexicographically ascending
order, then v1 should be equal to -1. If you use this option, keep in mind that v2 will then 
be limited to no more than 5 (because the number of these permutations grows rapidly, v1!)

if you just want to generate random permutations, then keep in mind
0 < v1, v2 < 100

also, 0 < n < 10

these limits are imposed to keep the output.pdf file from becoming too large.


IMPORTANT!!!
this is an example input.txt file:

3
-1 3
5 5
5 10

which will generate a output.pdf file containing: 

- all permutations of a set of 3 (there are
6 such permutations)

- 5 randomly generated permutations of a set of 5

- 5 randomly generated permutations of a set of 10


for using the makegraph.sh script, see the results.tex file for instructions on what arguments
to give to the script in order to produce the graph you want.
